# UtiliTrend
### Hackathon Project for Capital One
This app is a way to allow individuals to view their spending trends on utilities bills 
compared to other consumers in their area. 

### Motivation 
Banks like Capital One do a lot of analysis and reporting for customers using their credit cards, 
giving them more information to guide their spending habits. However, there is not much of this 
analysis for checking accounts. As such, UtiliTrend aims to provide similar analysis for users' 
checking accounts, with a specific focus on their utilities spending. This takes into account usersâ€™ cost of living, home square footage, and more.
